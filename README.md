# Post-Management-System
A Post Management System is likely a web application designed to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) posts. This system would utilize MySQL as the database to store post data, React for the front end to interact with users, and Node.js for the backend to handle server-side logic and database operations. It's a typical stack for building dynamic web applications that involve user-generated content management.
